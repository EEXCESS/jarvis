# Jarvis - A cultural heritage resources Butler


This is Jarvis. As the famous butler Edwin Jarvis assisted Howard and Tony Stark this Jarvis will assist you with your
recherche in the scientific and cultural heritage domain. For every paragraph on a web page, Jarvis identifies relevant
concepts and searches for resources in cultural and scientific libraries. I hope you enjoy getting the additional material
when browsing the web.

On some web sites you won't need Jarvis's help. You can configure when Jarvis is active by clicking on the Jarvis icon at the top.

# Credits

This work is based on the initial work done by [Mathias Moeller](https://github.com/mathiasmoeller) and was a GitHub project called
[eexcessredesign](https://github.com/mathiasmoeller/eexcessredesign).

The work resembles the practical part of Mathias's bachelor thesis on the automatic augmentation of webpages with cultural content.
